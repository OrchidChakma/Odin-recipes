        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Easy roasted garlic bread made with roasted garlic, butter, and Parmesan cheese.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 heads garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Slice the tops off of garlic heads, so the tip of each clove is exposed. Place garlic heads, cut-sides up, on a baking sheet; drizzle tops with olive oil.</p>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until garlic is soft, about 30 minutes.</p>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Set the oven to broil.</p>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Slice bread loaf in half horizontally; place cut-side up on a baking sheet.</p>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Squeeze garlic cloves from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, and parsley until well blended. Spread onto the cut sides of bread.</p>

        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>Broil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes.</p>
